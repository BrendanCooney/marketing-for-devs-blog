## Gitpod
Gitpod has been my chosen IDE. I nearly went with VSCode however stuck with Gitpod for the Purposes of this project. I have found it works well with Heroku and other applications. It was way faster than CodeAnywhere. 

## Python3
This project and all the recent walk throughs we have done at the code Institute have been created in Python. 

## Github
Github was used for version control 

## HTML
The Template files used in the project that bring the data to the Python Views are written in HTML.

## Javascript
The use of Javascript has been implemented for interactivity and communication to the user via messages pop-ups.

## CSS

Two differnt CSS stylesheets have been used in this project. One coming from the Codestar Blog and the other from a Bootstrap Theme page that has been modified. 

## PostgreSQL
PostgreSQl has been used as the relational databse management system for this application.  

## Heroku
Heroku has been used for hosting the deployed app it is linked to Github.

## Canva
Canva was used to source images and create the logo

## Paint.Net
Paint.Net was used to resize the blog images to keep them unifom

## Chat Gpt 
Chat GPT was used to create the actual Blog content. The reason for this is that I would like to show my fellow students that creating marketing content that can be a good base for posts is something Chat GPT and similar products can help with. 

## Cloudinary
Cloudinary was used to host the images and static files of the project linking up the images and stylesheets. 

## Bootsrap
Using Bootstrap has been an fundamental part of the entire website application. The Landing Page was taken from Start Bootstrap and was adatpted and changed with images from Canva to suit the project. 

## Django
This entire project was build with Python and Django and integrating them with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Building with Django has been a great experiece. As I have come to the end of the project I realise just how powerful Django is.
The Admin Panel and apps make it quick and easy for users once it has been deployed corectly. 

## Wireframes
These wireframes were created in Balsamic.
